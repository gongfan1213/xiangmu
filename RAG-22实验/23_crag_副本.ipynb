        "\n",
        "在本笔记本中，我将实现纠正性检索增强生成（Corrective RAG，简称CRAG）—— 这是一种先进的方法，通过动态评估检索到的信息，并在必要时利用网页搜索作为后备来纠正检索过程。\n",
        "\n",
        "CRAG 对传统 RAG 的改进体现在以下方面：\n",
        "\n",
        "- **在使用检索内容前进行评估**\n",
        "- **基于相关性动态切换知识源**\n",
        "- **当本地知识不足时通过网页搜索纠正检索结果**\n",
        "- **在适当情况下整合多源信息**\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### 关键术语说明\n",
        "- **RAG（检索增强生成）**：传统方法通过检索知识库生成回答，但缺乏对检索结果的动态验证\n",
        "- **动态评估机制**：CRAG 会先判断检索内容的准确性和相关性，避免直接使用错误信息\n",
        "- **网页搜索后备**：当本地知识库无法覆盖问题时，自动触发实时网络搜索补充信息\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### 核心流程示意\n",
        "1. **初始检索阶段**：从本地知识库获取候选答案\n",
        "2. **内容评估阶段**：通过可信度算法验证检索结果的准确性\n",
        "3. **动态纠正阶段**：\n",
        "   - 若评估通过：直接使用检索内容生成回答\n",
        "   - 若评估不通过：启动网页搜索获取补充信息\n",
        "4. **多源整合阶段**：融合本地知识与网络信息，生成最终回答\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "这种方法特别适合处理知识更新频繁的领域（如科技、金融），或需要结合实时数据的场景（如新闻分析、事件响应）。通过引入自纠机制，CRAG 显著提升了传统 RAG 在信息准确性和时效性上的不足。"

            "   - **CRAG**: The response is accurate and provides a clear explanation of the differences between machine learning and traditional programming. It correctly describes the rule-based nature of traditional programming and the data-driven adaptability of machine learning. It also accurately explains supervised and unsupervised learning.\n",

            "\n",
            "#### 2. **Relevance to the Query**:\n",
            "   - **CRAG**: The response is highly relevant, directly addressing the query by explaining the fundamental differences between machine learning and traditional programming. It focuses on the key aspects of the query without diverging into unrelated topics.\n",
            "   - **Standard RAG**: The response is also relevant but slightly broader. While it addresses the query, it includes additional details (e.g., handling complexity, development process, and applications) that, while useful, may not be strictly necessary to answer the query.\n",

            "   - **CRAG**: The response is complete in terms of addressing the core differences between machine learning and traditional programming. However, it does not delve into additional aspects like the development process or specific applications.\n",
            "   - **Standard RAG**: The response is more comprehensive, covering additional dimensions such as adaptability, handling complexity, and specific applications. This makes it more thorough for readers seeking a deeper understanding.\n",

            "   - **CRAG**: The response is well-organized and easy to follow. It uses clear language and provides examples to illustrate the differences. The inclusion of a brief explanation of supervised and unsupervised learning adds clarity.\n",
            "   - **Standard RAG**: The response is also well-organized, with a structured format that uses headings (e.g., \"Key Differences\") and bullet points.
